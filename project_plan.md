# Project Plan

## Background
The idea behind this project is the issue of manual deployment of CTFd. 
Deployment might not be an issue when dealing with a small amount of challenges 
but after some time it gets tedious. 

## Purpose 
The purpose of this project is to leverage the time spent on deploying CTF 
challenges with [CTFd](https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd).

The project is completed with satisfaction when all major goals are met. Extra
goals are convenient but not critical to the success of the project. 

## Goals
The project has a couple of 'Main Goals' which are critical to the success of
the project.

The challenges should be populated in the CTFd database so no manual setup is
required.
- [ ] Population of challenges in CTFd.

Custom index page deployment as with challenges.
- [ ] Show custom index page.

All challenges which need to be hosted in docker containers should be deployed.
- [ ] Deployment of challenges in docker containers.

Testing script setup for 'completed' project.
- [ ] Automated deployment of CTFd.

#### Extra goals
Default is HTTP, HTTPS would be nice.
- [ ] HTTPS nginx frontend.

Error handler for docker containers, notification, log, and restart container.
- [ ] Docker container monitoring.

Limit docker resources to prevent crashing/hang.
- [ ] Docker log, CPU, & MEM resources.

Develop challenge documentation.
- [ ] 'Creating a challenge' documentation.
    - [ ] Hardware challenges.

Docker swarm or kubernetes, for remote deployment.
- [ ] Remote deployment.
