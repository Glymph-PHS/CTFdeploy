# CTFdeployment
This deployment script is used for <b>FRESH</b> deployments of a CTF. Used to
cut the time of deployment on new instances of a CTF. Can be customized for
specific admins, challenges, and pages, as to skip the setup step.

Not meant to replace export/import. Rather used for <b>FRESH</b> deployments.

Make sure to read through the [CTFd](https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd) README
and install their dependencies before using this script, as it is dependent on
it.

Only tested on Linux.
